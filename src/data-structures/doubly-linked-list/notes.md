# Doubly Linked List

- Linked data structure that consists a set of sequentially linked records called node
- Each nodes consist of 2 fields called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes.
- Facillitate the traversal of list
- For only one sentinel node, the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node
