# Linked List

- Liner collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

- Each element points to the next

- Data structure consisting of group of nodes which represents a sequence

- Each Node is composed of data and a reference (link)

- Efficient for insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iternation

- Drawback would be the access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access such as random access is not feasible

- Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked list

## Complexities

---

### Time

- Access (O(n))
- Search (O(n))
- Insertion (O(1))
- Deletion (O(n))

---

### Space

O(n)
